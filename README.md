Some algorithms used for robot vision

- MNIST-recognition algorithm
- person-reid algorithm. It contains a baseline and an improved version. The improved algorithm refers to [strong-baseline](https://github.com/michuanhaohao/reid-strong-baseline) and the [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/TRMTMCT/Luo_Bag_of_Tricks_and_a_Strong_Baseline_for_Deep_Person_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf). The mAP is 85.9 without reranking in Market101 dataset.
- object tracking in videos (meanshift and CAM shift)
